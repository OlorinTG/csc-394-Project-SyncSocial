            Safety and Rules:                                                                
            <br><br>
            Protect your identity - don’t use your real name on FriendMatch, use a nickname for your username.  Protect your identity until you can trust your new friend. (After you have met in person, or verified each other’s identity through other means such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and other social network profiles if you can’t meet in person.)
            Use the FriendMatch messaging system until you can trust your new friend.  Don’t exchange email addresses or phone numbers until you have verified each other’s identity via meeting in person or other means if this is not possible.  Don’t respond to FriendMatch members who try to break this rule immediately.
            When you meet a new friend for the first time, use common sense safety precautions; let someone else know where you’ll be and when you expect to return home.
            Meet in a public place where there will be other people around. Please don’t meet a friend for the first time alone in the middle of the woods, for example.
            <br><br>
            Consider an App
            If you don't have someone to call and check in before you meet someone new for the first time, you can also try a safety app like EmergenSee, which offers security features like live support via your mobile device. 
            <br><br>
            Remember, it is up to you to be safe online and when meeting new people!
            <br><br><br><br>
